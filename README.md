# AP-Computer-Science-CodeHS
This repository contains answers to all the exercises and practice problems in the CodeHS AP Computer Science course (JAVA).
I highly recommend that you attempt to solve the exercises first before taking a look at these.

Additonally I want to mention that I created and used the "settersAndGetters.java" file to easily create setter and getter functions since it was needed in the course so much. Feel free to use this as you wish.
